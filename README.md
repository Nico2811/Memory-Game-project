# Memory Game
The Memory Game is my last project within Udacity's Programming Course.
It is a webpage, which displays an interactive memory game with 16 cards.

## Files
This folder contains 5 folders/files, including:
- the **HTML-file**
- the **CSS-file**
- the **JavaScript-file**
- the **Img-folder**, which contains the background-image of the page
- the **README-file** you are reading right now ;)

## Installation
There's no need of installing anything. You just have to open the **index**-file
with any common browser, like Chrome or Firefox.

## Usage
The game is interactive.
- If you click on a card it flips over
- The rules are just the same as in an analog memory game
- You win the game by matching all 8 pairs
- Once you won the game, you can see your stats and restart the game
